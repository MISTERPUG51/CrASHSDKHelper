# CrASH SDK Helper
## What is CrASH SDK Helper?
CrASH SDK Helper is a program that I wrote to make the CrASH SDK easier to use. This program contains a program editor, links to documentation and tutorials, and a GUI.
## What is CrASH SDK in the first place?
[CrASH](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/87/8772.html) is an assembly shell for the TI-82, and [CrASH SDK](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/87/8773.html) is an ancient program that compiles assembly programs for the TI-82 for use with CrASH.
<br>
The latest version of the CrASH SDK was released in 1999 and was written for DOS. Because of this, it won't run on 64-bit Windows. It technically runs on a 32-bit installation of Windows 10, but it has some issues.

## Supported Operating Systems
Note: CrASH SDK Helper requires .NET Framework 2.0 to be installed on your system.
### 32-bit
Since the CrASH SDK is a 16-bit DOS program, it doesn't run on 64-bit versions of Windows without the use of external programs (listed under 64-bit).

<br>
I have tested it on Windows XP, Windows 98 SE, and Windows 10 (32-bit). The CrASH SDK doesn't run entirely correctly on Windows 10, but it still compiles the program properly. Other versions of Windows might work, but I haven't tested any others. I highly recommend Windows XP.
