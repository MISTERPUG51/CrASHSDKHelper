# CrASH SDK Helper
## What is CrASH SDK Helper?
CrASH SDK Helper is a program that I wrote to make the CrASH SDK easier to use. This program contains a program editor, links to documentation and tutorials, and a GUI.
## What is CrASH SDK in the first place?
[CrASH](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/87/8772.html) is an assembly shell for the TI-82, and [CrASH SDK](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/87/8773.html) is an ancient program that compiles assembly programs for the TI-82 for use with CrASH.
<br>
The latest version of the CrASH SDK was released in 1999 and was written for DOS. Because of this, it won't run on 64-bit Windows. It technically runs on a 32-bit installation of Windows 10, but it has some issues.

## Supported Operating Systems
Since the CrASH SDK doesn't run correctly on modern Windows, and CrASH SDK Helper relies on the CrASH SDK, CrASH SDK Helper is also limited to older Windows operating systems.

<br>
I have tested it on a Windows XP PC and a Windows 98 SE virtual machine. Other versions of Windows might work, but I haven't tested any others. I highly recommend Windows XP.

CrASH SDK Helper also requires .NET Framework 2.0 to be installed on your system.
