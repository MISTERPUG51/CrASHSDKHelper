 CrASH Instruction Manual
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Welcome to CrASH.

  We would like to congratulate you for choosing CrASH, one of the most
powerful shells available for the TI-82.  If you are new to CrASH or
assembly language programs, please read this manual carefully before trying
to run CrASH.

  Thoroughly read the setup instructions below before trying to run CrASH on
your TI-82.  If you are ultimately unable to run CrASH on your calculator,
please contact the authors (see below).


 Introducing CrASH
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  CrASH is a software program written for the TI-82 that allows the user to
run programs written in assembly language.  When CrASH is invoked, it will
display a list of assembly programs, from which a selection can be made.
Similar programs do exist, such as Ash, also for the TI-82.

 System Requirements
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- A TI-82 with rom versions 16.0, 17.0, 18.0, or 19.0
- A link cable and software on a computer

  It is also possible to transfer CrASH from one TI-82 to another, using the
standard link cable and the calculators' memory backup function.  Remember,
however, that this will erase any programs and data already on the receiving
calculator.

  CrASH v1.6 has been tested to function correctly on TI-82 calculators
with rom versions 16.0, 17.0, 18.0 and 19.0.  In order to check the rom
version of your TI-82, go to the MODE menu and press [Alpha]-[S].  A screen
displaying the rom version should be displayed, along with "Enter Self Test?"
Press [CLEAR] to exit this screen.  DO NOT press [ENTER], as this will cause
the calculator to perform a self-test procedure that ends with a memory
reset.


 Features
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Allows you to run programs written in assembly language on the 82.
- Compatibility confirmed with 82 ROM versions 16.0, 17.0, 18.0 and 19.0.
- Uncrashable "standard" key handler *1 for native CrASH programs.
- Does not require you to press enter after running prgmCRASH.
- "Boss Key" routine that does not crash.
- Runs most Ash 3.0 programs. *2
- Relocates programs in memory for easy programming.
- Built-in random number routine and fast display copy routine.
- Easy access to the Link and Mem menus directly from CrASH.
- Nice show off of our programming skill with a smooth scrolling menu bar :)
- Other built-in programming subroutines.

*1 The non-crashable keyboard handler only affects CrASH programs.  Any Ash 3
programs running under CrASH will still crash if you turn the calculator off
during a KEY_HAND.  Correctly written CrASH programs, however, will not.

*2 CrASH is compatible with most Ash 3 programs; that is, programs written for
Ash v3.0 will run on CrASH.  The primary exception are the "self-loading"
Ash programs - the Ash programs that can be run simply by executing the
program directly without loading Ash first.

- NEW! - Now allows TI-OS hidden programs.
- NEW! - Faster relocation.
- NEW! - Faster ROM_CALL subroutine.
- NEW! - Faster CR_GRBCopy subroutine.
- NEW! - CrASH upgrade available.

 Installing CrASH
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  If you are a current user of CrASH, refer to "Upgrading to a New Version
of CrASH," below.

  The installation of CrASH onto your TI-82 is actually quite a simple
process!  All that needs to be done is for the CrASH.82B backup file to be
transferred to the calculator via the TI-GRAPHLINK software or other means.
If you have access to another TI-82 already has CrASH on it, it is also
possible to transfer it from that calculator by sending a memory backup
to your calculator.

  Because this involves the transfer of backup files, the memory of the
destination calculator WILL be cleared.  In order to prevent losing data,
copy current files from your calculator onto your computer.  If you are
obtaining CrASH from another calculator, it is also possible to copy the data
that you wish to keep over to that calculator and then receive a backup that
contains that data.

 Upgrading to a New Version of CrASH
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  You may now upgrade an older version of CrASH to the newest version without
losing any programs or data simply by running the program called CrUPG16.82P,
available in the upgrade package.  This simplifies upgrading calculators,
especially if you have many programs on it or you wish to give a copy of it
to other users who already have a previous version of CrASH.  (CrUPG16.82P
requires CrASH v1.1 or newer.)


 Using CrASH
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  To start CrASH, go to the program menu by pressing [PRGM].  Select the
program called CRASH.  After pressing [ENTER] to run CrASH, hold it down
until it loads.  A list of every assembly program will be displayed on your
screen.  If no assembly programs exist on your calculator, then you will see
that your screen will display "No Programs."

  Inside the CrASH shell, you can change the contrast as normal.  You may
also press [2nd]+[OFF] to turn off the calculator, press [2nd]+[LINK] to
access the Link menu, or [2nd]+[MEM] to access the Memory menu.  In addition,
the calculator will automatically turn off when left on for about five
minutes with no activity.  To exit CrASH, press [MODE] or [2nd]+[QUIT].
Because of the safe keyboard handler, it is safe to turn off the calculator
during CrASH.

  Use the up/down arrow keys, highlight a program you wish to run, then press
[ENTER].  If you have more than 9 assembly programs, only 9 will appear in
the list.  You can press the right/left arrow keys to see the other programs.

  Once you press [ENTER], the assembly program will begin execution.  Follow
the instructions as indicated in the program or a help file included with the
program.

  You cannot run CrASH assembly programs directly from the prgm menu.  The
CrASH files in your prgm menu when you hit [PRGM] on your calculator will
start with a inverted lower-case 'a' signifying that it is a program written
in 'a'ssembly, and when you try, you will get a syntax error.

  NEVER delete the matrices called 'a' or 'b' on your TI-82, because these two
variables are necessary for the correct operation of CrASH.  Deleting either
matrix can cause undesired operation on your system.  Do not worry about
their sizes; one seems to take up 39626 bytes, but actually, it takes up only
6 bytes.  All together, for the correct functionality of CrASH, you only need
three variables on your TI-82: CRASH, a, and b.

  If your TI-82 has any hardware turboing, CrASH may also be incompatible
with your calculator.  If you do, please contact an author of CrASH.


 Compatibility
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  CrASH was written to be compatible with the well known Ash v3.0.  CrASH
therefore supports the running of such programs.  However, CrASH does not
support Ash v3.0 programs which can be run directly from the [PRGM] menu, as
mentioned before.  This even means that these programs will not even be
displayed as part of the menu, and therefore you cannot select them.  Also,
some Ash v3.0 programs might not function correctly inside CrASH.

  Although CrASH can run Ash programs, Ash will NOT run programs specifically
written for CrASH.  In order to check for compatibility with Ash programs, be
sure to check that an Ash program will not conflict with part of CrASH.  We
have not yet encountered an Ash program (that is not self-loading) that does
not work with CrASH.


 Programming for CrASH
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  See CrASHprg.TXT for information on how to program for CrASH.


 If Your Calculator Crashes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  We have (hopefully) removed every bug that will cause CrASH to crash.
However, this possibility still exists, and we want you to know how to get
your calculator working again.  When your calculator does not respond to any
keys and/or the calculator is displaying a bunch of garbage, it may be
crashed.  If this happens, there is a fairly simple procedure to follow to
reset your calculator's memory and get it working again.  Even when we wrote
CrASH (and crashed our calculators several thousand times), we never needed
to go to step 5 (lithium battery).  It's not very common to have to remove
all the batteries.

 1. Open the battery cover.
 2. Remove one AAA battery.  This will cause the display to turn off if it
    hadn't already.
 3. Hold the ON button for 5 seconds.
 4. Reinsert the battery and try turning it on.
 5. If the calculator still doesn't respond, you may repeat the above process
    or try removing the lithium battery (the round one) and all the AAA
    batteries for 2 to 3 minutes.  Replace them and try again.
 6. If THIS doesn't work, your calculator probably didn't work in the first
    place.
