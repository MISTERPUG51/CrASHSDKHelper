CrASH SDK Helper

What is CrASH SDK Helper?
-------------------------
CrASH SDK Helper is a program that I wrote to make the CrASH SDK easier to use. This program contains a program editor, links to documentation and tutorials, and a GUI.

What is CrASH SDK in the first place?
-------------------------------------
CrASH is an assembly shell for the TI-82, and CrASH SDK is an ancient program that compiles assembly programs for the TI-82 for use with CrASH.

Supported Operating Systems
---------------------------
Note: CrASH SDK Helper requires .NET Framework 2.0 to be installed on your system.

Since the CrASH SDK is a 16-bit DOS program, and this program relies on it, CrASH SDK Helper doesn't work on 64-bit versions of Windows. I have tested it on Windows XP, Windows 98 SE, and Windows 10 (32-bit). The CrASH SDK doesn't run entirely correctly on Windows 10, but it still compiles the program properly. Other versions of Windows might work, but I haven't tested any others. I highly recommend Windows XP.

Installing
----------
CrASH SDK Helper can be installed on your computer, or you can use the portable version. If you use the portable version, make sure that the full path of the folder does not contain any spaces. The CrASH SDK will not work properly if it contains spaces.
